**Elite manipulation of ethnic tension and Historic grievances of
nationhood**

Intolerance is not always and not even usually the result of centuries
old conflict. Tension between groups, which may, in fact, have existed
for ages, is manipulated by elites to achieve their personal, political
and economic objectives.

Members of ethnic groups are compelled by leaders to focus on all
members of another group as enemies. Loyalty to “own” group is tested by
actions and attitudes directed against the “out” group. A battle over
resources—land, water, mineral wealth—is made into a battle that
requires that all members of the out group are defined as enemies of our
group.

There is no basis in ethnically torn societies for resolution of these
conflicts. The resource and power conflicts lead only to an allocation
by group membership. The “out” group as a whole must get less than “own”
group. All members of the “out” group must individually have less than
members of “own” group. No other basis for the allocation of resources,
political and civil rights, and political power is advanced or
considered.

**Where do we start to look for answers?**

1.  Rights attach to individuals regardless of group membership.

2.  Nation is defined by political, civil, and economic rights. Nation
    is not defined by ethnic affinity.

3.  A shared understanding that rights are defined for each individual.

4.  Realization that existence of different people in society and their recognition, rights, benefits and progress does not restrict or limit anyone else.
